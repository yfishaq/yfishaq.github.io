# 3-in-1 Coat
A 3-in-1 coat is a multi-use coat, backpack, and sleeping bag for individuals who are unhoused, especially during the cold seasons. A parka coat that converts into a backpack and sleeping bag. The purpose of our project is to provide better living conditions for the unhoused, by providing them with protection from harsh weather conditions, as well as portable storage, and improved sleeping conditions.

## My Angle
My role in the project was to come up with an idea that addresses a social issue of concern.
