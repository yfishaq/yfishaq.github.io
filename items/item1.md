# Therapy Box
The Therapy Box takes on a mental health approach to the traditional box, by combining aromatherapy and light therapy components. We gathered some data about different kinds of therapy that could help elevate user’s mood. We were successful in hacking a traditional box.

## My Angle
My role in the project was to brainstorm ideas, edit the slides and doing the citations.
